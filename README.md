# Weather Dashboard

## Objective

The objective of this assignment was to create a dynamic weather dashboard using servir side API's that allows the user to search for a city and have the current weather and the five day forecast returned. The results are displayed upon clicking the button after the city search input. 

The goal was to provide dynamic UI for the user in order for them to get the necessary information for collecting and viewing weather information. 

The data and weather icons for the weather dashboard was provided by [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
